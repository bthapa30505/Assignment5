# Summary 
This project provided a strong understanding of how deterministic and randomized quick sort work in practice. I was able to compare their performance in different scenarios, such as sorted, reverse-sorted, and random data, and observe how deterministic quick sort struggles with poor pivot selection in some instances. Implementing both versions of quicksort helped me to understand how pivot selection impacts time as well as memory efficiency. Additionally, I also gained insights into recursion depth and how it impacts memory usage, especially for larger inputs. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of quick sortâ€™s time complexity and why randomized pivot selection leads to more balanced partitions and better performance in most cases.
